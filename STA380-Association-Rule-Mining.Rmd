## Association rule mining

Revisit the notes on association rule mining and the R example on music playlists: playlists.R and playlists.csv. Then use the data on grocery purchases in groceries.txt and find some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets. The data file is a list of shopping baskets: one person's basket for each row, with multiple items per row separated by commas. Pick your own thresholds for lift and confidence; just be clear what these thresholds are and say why you picked them. Do your discovered item sets make sense? Present your discoveries in an interesting and visually appealing way.

Notes:

1. This is an exercise in visual and numerical story-telling. Do be clear in your description of what you've done, but keep the focus on the data, the figures, and the insights your analysis has drawn from the data, rather than technical details.

2. The data file is a list of baskets: one row per basket, with multiple items per row separated by commas. You'll have to cobble together your own code for processing this into the format expected by the "arules" package. This is not intrinsically all that hard, but it is the kind of data-wrangling wrinkle you'll encounter frequently on real problems, where your software package expects data in one format and the data comes in a different format. Figuring out how to bridge that gap is part of the assignment, and so we won't be giving tips on this front.

```{r loading libraries, echo = FALSE}
#Loading the required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(arules)  
library(arulesViz)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

```{r Reading the dataset}
#Reading the groceries.txt data
groceries_raw <-  readLines('C:/Users/krish/Downloads/STA380-master/data/groceries.txt')

# Number of customers
n = length(groceries_raw)

# Split each row into list of items purchased by a single user.
total_items_list <-  list()
for (line in groceries_raw){
  items <- unlist(strsplit(line, ","))
  total_items_list <- c(total_items_list, list(items))
}
#summary(total_items_list)
```
The data contains the purchase history of 9835 transactions and the list of items bought in each transaction. Now that, all the items are in a list, let's see which items are the more frequently bought and which items are rarely bought.
```{r List of items}
#combining all items in a single vector and counting the frequency of each items
all_items <- unlist(total_items_list)
item_counts <- data.frame(Item = names(table(all_items)), 
                          Count = as.vector(table(all_items)))
summary(item_counts)

#plotting the top 20 items
sorted_item_counts <- item_counts[order(item_counts$Count, decreasing = TRUE), ]

ggplot(head(sorted_item_counts, 20), aes(x = reorder(Item, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Items", x = "Item", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(tail(sorted_item_counts, 20), aes(x = reorder(Item, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(title = "Rarely bought Items", x = "Item", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
It can be seen that there are a total of 169 different items in the data. Among them, 20 most frequently bought items and 20 rarely bought items are shown in the above bar plots.
Now, we will dig deep into the data and check whether there are not associations among the items.
```{r Association rules}
#Assigning the items to each customer
customers <- c(1:n)
groceries <- setNames(total_items_list, customers)

## Cast this variable as a special arules "transactions" class.
groceries_trans <-  as(groceries, "transactions")
summary(groceries_trans)

# Now run the 'apriori' algorithm
# Look at rules with support > .01 & confidence >.1 & length (# items) <= 4
groceries_rules <- apriori(groceries_trans, 
                          parameter=list(support=.01, confidence=.1, maxlen=4))

# Look at the output... so many rules!
inspect(groceries_rules)
```
There are 435 rules generated by this `apriori` function with support = 0.01, confidence = 0.1 and maximum number of items to be considered is 4. As expected, the most bought items like *whole milk*, *other vegetables*, *rolls/buns* etc., don't need any associations. However, there are certain items which are bought with other items. Let's dive deep into these rules for better understanding.
```{r Subsets of Association rules}
## Choose a subset
inspect(subset(groceries_rules, subset=lift > 3))
```
There are only 8 rules which gives a lift more than 3 and almost all are related to vegetables and fruits.
```{r subset confidence}
inspect(subset(groceries_rules, subset=confidence > 0.5))
```
There are only 14 items with confidence more than 0.5 and all these are for buying *whole milk* or *other vegetables*. This shows that though these are the most bought items, the probability of buying them increases when combined with other items.
```{r subset lift and confidence}
inspect(subset(groceries_rules, subset=lift > 2 & confidence > 0.4))
```
This shows that *whole milk* and *other vegetables* are the more associated with other items.
Now, let us see these rules in plots.
```{r plotting the rules}
# "two key" plot: coloring is by size (order) of item set
plot(groceries_rules, method='two-key plot') + 
  labs(title = "Association Rules Scatter Plot", x = "Support", y = "Confidence")  +
  theme_minimal()

# graph-based visualization
# export
# associations are represented as edges
# For rules, each item in the LHS is connected
# with a directed edge to the item in the RHS. 
groceries_graph = associations2igraph(subset(groceries_rules, lift>1.5), associationsAsNodes = FALSE)
igraph::write_graph(groceries_graph, file='groceries.graphml', format = "graphml")
```
This plot shows the relation between support and confidence of each rule. It can be inferred that the support is low for most of the items. Only a few items have more support and confidence is low for those items. The below picture from graphml file shows the list of items and their associations.
